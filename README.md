# CBPQ

A simple application for skydivers in Brazil to check their license status.

## Getting started

Create `.env` configuration file (copy from `.env.dev`).

Change `/android/key.properties` file with the JKS key.

Install the dependencies:

```
flutter packages get
```

Run the app:

```
flutter run
```

## The motivation

The [official website](www.cbpq.org.br) is not prepared for mobile devices and there is no official app for this service.

It is common to see athletes in the middle of the dropzone strugging to access the main website to check license information, and dropzone managers have no quick access to validate an athelet status.

Made for skydivers, by skydivers ;)

## How it works

There is no API provided by the official service so the app needs to do a little "magic".

1. The app sends a GET request to the official site "Consulta Licen√ßa" URL passing the CPF or CBPQ informed by the user.
2. The HTML response is then edited to match XML format. The data is then extracted from the now readable XML and displayed to the user.
